## Current problems vs Solutions through Win-Win

|Problems of the current mediation system| Solution through Win-Win |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|
|__Trusting Credentials__<br>Parties cannot easily verify mediators' credentials, and the number of innacurate or even false credentials in the field is increasing constantly in the last years.|__Trust__<br>Universities and peacebuilding organizations verify their graduates on Cardano. Parties have access to professional mediators and can check their certifications.|
|__Mediation process slow to start__<br>Conflicting parties do not have months to start the mediation process when they are ready to kill each other, and the current process to set up a mediation might take that long.|__Convenience__<br>Parties find mediators specialized for their case instantaneously through our DApp. Clients flow to qualified mediators, according to their availability.|
|__Refund/payment guarantees__<br>Mediators may favor the party who pays their fees first. Mediators sometimes have to run after their money. Parties have no refund guarantees on a no-show by the mediator.|__No-hassle payment__<br>Refunds and payments are handled by smart contracts. The mediator doesn't know who paid first, therefore lower risk of bias in the mediation process. The parties are refunded in case of a no-show by the mediator.|
|__Ethical mediators don't have repeat clients__<br>As the DevOps of Conflict Resolution, mediation helps parties to solve not only their acute, but also future disputes.<br>Good for the world, but bad for business.|__Mediators focus on the process__<br>Win-Win pre-selects suitable mediators for any given case. On Win-Win, mediators can focus on doing their work, and not trying to be the loudest on social media.|

## Budget breakdown

Eli, Ganesh, and Matthias are part of [Gimbalabs' Plutus Project Based Learning (PPBL) Team](https://discord.com/channels/767416282198835220/829467351983587328/880462584434802689).
As there is overlap between coming up with solutions to the challenges of this proposal and creating educational content as part of the PPBL Team, this proposal is in part funded by Gimbalabs. This reduces some of the labor costs and is reflected in the funds requested.

Furthermore, Win-Win is part of CardStarter's _Hack Cardano!_ hackathon and has a shot of winning prize money and development support. In the event that Win-Win receives such an award, the funds here requested will be used to accelerate development and integration of features that are planned for a later date.

| Category                                         | Amount in USD |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------:|
| Labor (team member compensation)                 | 20816         |
| Tech services (hosting, GCP, GSuite etc.) 1 year | 2184          |
| Incorporation and legal fees                     | 2000          |
|                                                  |               |
| Total                                            | 25000         |


## Project sustainability

Once developed, Win-Win will generate income by charging a small, one-digit percent fee on every mediation process that happens through the platform. By then, the project will no longer need funding through Catalyst or other means, and it will be sustainable for the long term.
